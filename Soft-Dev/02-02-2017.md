## Aim: Documenting Your Data 

##### Do Now: What are some drawbacks to using an SQL database?

- There can be a lot of empty columns if they're not required filling 
- Impossible to dynamically edit the schema 
- Can't sort into the database
- Issues when trying to relate large tables 

##### NoSQL

- Graph-based databases
- Map-based 
- Document-based ( MongoDB )

#### Document-oriented Database

- Records in Document-Oriented DBs are stores as documents.
- Each document contains all the data that is associated with the given record, in key-value pairs ( fields )
- Documents in the same collection do not need to have the same fields
- Documents that are meant to be stored together are put into collections. 
- You do not need to specify the type of data put into each field
- Fields can contain many different kinds of data, including lists and other documents.
- Each document has its own primary key, usually generated by mongo
- Looks similar to json and Python dict.
- There are various types that can be stored in a document ( Ex. Date )

##### Mongo in Python

```PYthon
from pymongo import MongoClient
client = MongoClient('127.0.0.1')
database = client['foo']
database = client.foo 
coll = database.collection1
coll['doc1']

```
