#### Preliminary Questions

1. Write the equation for the reaction of sodium sulfite with sulfur.
   $$
   Na_2SO_3 + S + 5H_2O \rightarrow Na_2S_2O_3 \bullet 5H_2O
   $$

2. In the procedure for this experiment, which reactant, $Na_2SO_3$ or $S$, is in excess, and by how many moles?
   $$
   \text{mol of } Na_2SO_3 = \frac{m}{\text{molar mass of } Na_2SO_3} = \frac{12.6g}{126.043g/mol} = 0.1 \text{ mol} \\
   \text{mol of } S = \frac{m}{\text{molar mass of } S} = \frac{3.5g}{32.06g/mol} = 0.109 \text{ mol} \\
   \text{difference in mol} = 0.1 -0.109 = 0.009 \text{ mol}
   $$
   S is in excess by 0.009 mol.

3. Describe the proper disposal of the solution in part 1a of the Qualitative Tests.
   Waste should be disposed of in **inorganic synthesis waste bottle**.
   Sodium Thiosulfate pentahydrate + filter paper should be disposed of in beaker labeled **waste sodium thiosulfate**
