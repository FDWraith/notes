## Pre-Lab Questions

1. Vapor is the gaseous form a liquid that has just been boiled away.
2. $M = \frac{gRT}{PV} = \frac{0.80 \times 0.08206 \times 373.2}{0.987 \times 0.280} = 88.7 g/mol$

## Post-Lab Questions

1. The pinhole is open to the atmosphere, meaning that the pressure inside the flask would be the current atmospheric pressure. Furthermore, the pinhole allows excess vapor to escape, leaving only the amount of vapor needed to fill the flask inside.
2. We are dealing with the same substance, and any excess vapor formed during the boiling process will simply leave the pinhole.
3. The flask was not completely dry before the experiment was done, and trace amounts of water vapor ended up inside the flask.
4. If the liquid vaporized at room temperature, it would more difficult to handle it as a liquid at room temperature, because it would vaporize away.
5. (c) The molecular weight would be unaffected by this error and it would be the correct value
6. Experiment 1: $M = \frac{gRT}{PV} = \frac{(0.266 + 0.05) \times 0.08206 \times 373.4}{1.01 \times 0.150} = 63.9 g/mol$
   Experiment 2 : $M = \frac{gRT}{PV} = \frac{(0.269 + 0.05) \times 0.08206 \times 373.4}{1.01 \times 0.150} = 64.5 g/mol$
   New Average: $64.2 g/mol$
