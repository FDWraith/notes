## Aim: Get more power from your sockets

Sockets in C

- accept ( server only ) <sys/socket.h>

  - returns the socket descriptor of the new socket

  - ```
    accept(<socket descriptor>, <socket address>, <address length>)
    ```

    - socket descriptor: return value of socket
    - address: pointer to a struct sockaddr
      - will contain the correct address information after the connection is made
    - length: pointer to a variable with the size of the address
      - will be set after the connection is made

  - ```C
    bind( sd, (struct sockaddr *)&sock, sizeof(sock));
    listen(sd, 1);
    stuct sockaddr_in sock1;
    unsigned int socklen = sizeof(sock1 );
    connection = accept( sd, (struct sockaddr *)&sock1, socklen;
    printf("connection from: %s\n", inet_ntoa(sock1.sin_addr));
    char buffer[256];
    read(connection , buffer, sizeof(buffer));
    printf("Server got: [%s]\n", buffer);
    ```

- connect ( client only ) <sys/socket.h> <sys/types/h>

  - connect to another program over a socket

    - does not create another socket, unlike accept

  - handles the client end of the 3-way handshake

  - ```
    connect(<socket descriptor>, <address>, <address size>)
    ```

    - address struct is the same as in bind

  - ```c
    bind(sd, (struct sockaddr*)&sock, sizeof(sock));
    conect( sd, (struct sockaddr*)&sock, sizeof(sock));
    write(sd, "hello", 6);
    ```
