CS 2800 Homework 12 - Fall 2018

This homework is to be done INDIVIDUALLY
It was designed to be yet ANOTHER "practice exam"
so try to do it under exam conditions.....although 
I make no guantees that it can be done in 2 hours. In fact it will likely
take more than 2 hours but I expect less than 4 hours.

Also, just a reminder that the exam is done on paper. Last fall I had a number
of students have difficulty on the exam only to find out that they did all of their practice
on their laptops (including the practice exam) and then struggled on the main exam. Your brain
is an associative recall system. If you learn one way, you should try to reproduce those conditions
when doing an exam and that includes studying with the pencil to write with a pencil.
 *  It might be a good idea to do this homework on paper and then transfer your solutions
    to the lisp file.

 * You are responsible for your own homework submission.  You can't rely on your
   partners any more and your work should be done by yourself.

 * Submit the homework file (this file) on Blackboard.  Do not rename 
   this file.  There will be a 10 point penalty for this.

Induction, Programming, and Tail Recursion Proofs

How you approach a proof is not necessarily obvious and even your TAs and
instructors have to try a proof multiple ways. It's fine to try the wrong 
I.S. at first and then adjust. If you can figure out what inductive assumptions
and stopping conditions you need for a proof before starting, that's even better.
The point being: a false start to your proof doesn't imply (via MP) that you
don't understand the topic but practice reduces the number of false starts.
This assignment will hopefully give you that practice.

***************
THEME: I Love the End of Term
The end is fast approaching and although many of you might be concerned about 
the exam, I've regularly pointed out a key difference from the first half
of the semester: you can make your own problems.  The fact we can come up
with properties related to a function, we can write tail recursive versions of a function
and the fact we may need to prove a function is admissible (and thus terminates)
means that any single function can spawn a slew of questions touching on all aspects
of the course. Give it a try on your own......

....or let's do that now. Take the functions weave.
We will keep revisiting this functions throughout the homework.  First, let's define
functions used throughout the homework.

Note that I'm denoting all questions with
##..............## so you don't accidentally overlook one (you can do a 
search).

Also note that many questions are "EXTRA" meaning they are worth no points and won't be 
graded.  These are for you to potentially get more practice.  The homework would be painfully
long if we required you to prove all the questions.  Hence keep an eye out for what is optional
and what is not.

; Section A: Admissibility, Measure Functions and Induction Schemes
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
#|
First, let's review the conditions necessary for a function to be admitted in
ACL2s (I'm paraphrasing below):
1) The function f is a new function symbol
2) The input variables are distinct variable symbols
3) The body of the function is a well formed term, possibly using a recursive
call to f and mentioning no variables freely (ie only the input variables)
4) The function is terminating
5) IC=>OC is a theorem
6) The body contract holds under the assumption that the IC holds (ie there
isn't a body contract violation if the input contract is true)

For each function fn below (f1...f6), determine if the function fn is admissible:

If fn is admissible: 
   1) provide a measure function mn that can be used to prove it terminates
   2) Write the proof obligations for fn using mn that can show it terminates.
   3) Prove each proof obligation 
   4) Write the induction scheme that fn gives rise to.

If fn is NOT admissible, 
   1) Give your justification as to why (conditions 1-6 above).
      a) If the problem is syntactic (admissibility conditions 1-3) then tell us what
         part of the function has a problem.
      b) If the issue is with conditions 4-6, then give an input that will illustrate
         the violation.
   2) Give the (invalid) induction scheme that fn gives rise to.

 Section B: Weave Proofs
 Next, let's do some proofs involving the function in
 min-l and weave.

---------------------------------------------
Hopefully Helpful Theorems
You may assume the following theorems (or prove them
if you want the practice):

phi_inapp: (listp x)/\ (listp y) => 
           (in e (app x y)) = ((in e x) \/ (in e y))

Assumption A1. (listp x) /\ (listp y)/\(listp z) /\ (in e y) =>
               (perm (cons e z) (app x y) = (perm z (app x (del e y)))

....in other words, even if e exists in list x, you can delete e from y
(provided it's in y) to see if z is a permutation of x and y minus element e.
This is used for the optional question below.

B1. Prove (listp x)/\ (listp y) => 
           (in e (weave x y)) = ((in e x) \/ (in e y))

Induction Scheme (for weave):
1. ~((listp x) /\ (listp y)) => phi
2. (listp x) /\ (listp y) /\ (endp x) => phi
3. (listp x) /\ (listp y) /\ ~(endp x) /\ (endp y) => phi
4. (listp x) /\ (listp y) /\ ~(endp x) /\ ~(endp y) /\ phi | ((x (rest x)) (y (rest y))) => phi


Obligation 1
C1. ~((listp x) /\ (listp y)) 
C2. (listp x)
C3. (listp y)
--------------
C4. f {C1, C2, C3}

f => phi is t, so Obligation 1 is proven.

Obligation 2
C1. (listp x)
C2. (listp y)
C3. (endp x)
-------------

LHS:(in e (weave x y))
  = {def of weave, C3}
    (in e y)
RHS:(in e x) \/ (in e y)
  = {def of in, C3}
    nil \/ (in e y)
  = {PL}
    (in e y)

LHS = RHS, so Obligation 2 is proven.

Obligation 3
C1. (listp x)
C2. (listp y)
C3. ~(endp x)
C4. (endp y)
----------------

LHS:(in e (weave x y))
  = {def of weave, C3, C4}
    (in e x)
RHS:(in e x) \/ (in e y)
  = {def of in, C4}
    (in e x) \/ nil
  = {PL}
    (in e x)
 
LHS = RHS, so Obligation 3 is proven.

Obligation 4
C1. (listp x)
C2. (listp y)
C3. ~(endp x)
C4. ~(endp y)
C5. (listp (rest x)) /\ (listp (rest y)) => (in e (weave (rest x) (rest y))) = (in e (rest x)) \/ (in e (rest y)) 
-----------------
C6. (listp (rest x)) {C1, C3, def of listp}
C7. (listp (rest y)) {C2, C4, def of listp}
C8. (in e (weave (rest x) (rest y))) = (in e (rest x)) \/ (in e (rest y)) {C6, C7, C5, MP}

LHS:(in e (weave x y))
  = {def of weave, C3, C4}
    (in e (cons (first x) (cons (first y) (weave (rest x) (rest y)))))
  = {def of in, first-rest axiom}
    (if (equal e (first x))
        t
        (in e (cons (first y) (weave (rest x) (rest y)))))
CASE 1 : (equal e (first x))
  = {CASE 1}
    t
RHS:(in e x) \/ (in e y)
  = {def of in, CASE 1}
    t
LHS = RHS, so CASE 1 is t.
CASE 2 : ~(equal e (first x))
  = {CASE 2}
    (in e (cons (first y) (weave (rest x) (rest y))))
  = {def of in, first-rest axiom}
    (if (equal e (first y))
        t
        (in e (weave (rest x) (rest y))))
CASE A : (equal e (first y))
  = {CASE A}
    t
RHS:(in e x) \/ (in e y)
  = {def of in, CASE A}
    t
LHS = RHS, so CASE A is t.
CASE B : ~(equal e (first y))
  = {CASE B}
    (in e (weave (rest x) (rest y))) 
  = {C8}
    (in e (rest x)) \/ (in e (rest y))
RHS:(in e x) \/ (in e y)
  = {def of in, CASE 1}
    (in e (rest x)) \/ (in e y)
  = {def of in, CASE B} 
    (in e (rest x)) \/ (in e (rest y))
LHS = RHS, so CASE B is t.
All cases for CASE 2 are proven, so CASE 2 is proven.
All cases for Obligation 4 are proven, so Obligation 4 is proven.




EXTRA (no points.....phi_permWA only): prove 
Phi_permWA: (listp x)/\(listp y) =>(perm (weave x y)(app x y)) 
using the induction scheme for weave.

             (equal (min-l (weave l1 l2)) 
                    (min (min-l l1)(min-l l2)))))

Prove B2....and you may need some cases (sorry) due to min-l's input contract.
The proof gets a bit ugly but it's good practice.
Also notice that I changed the definition of min-l to make the proof easier.
Please use the new definition.

I also needed a simple lemma but just so you don't need two lemmata you can assume
the following:
B2b: (rationalp r1)/\(rationalp r2)=> ((min r1 r2) = (min r2 r1))

;; min: rational x rational -> rational
;; (min r1 r2) returns the smaller value of r1 and r2.
(defunc min (r1 r2)
  :input-contract (and (rationalp r1)(rationalp r2))
  :output-contract (rationalp (min r1 r2))
  (if (<= r1 r2) r1 r2))

;; min-l: LOR (non-empty -> Rational
;; (min-l l) returns the smallest element in l.
(defunc min-l (l)
  :input-contract (and (lorp l)(consp l))
  :output-contract (rationalp (min-l l))
  (if (endp (rest l))
       (first l)
       (min (first l)(min-l (rest l)))))

Induction Scheme (for min-l):
1. ~((lorp l) /\ (consp l)) => phi
2. (lorp l) /\ (consp l) /\ (endp (rest l)) => phi
3. (lorp l) /\ (consp l) /\ ~(endp (rest l)) /\ phi | (l (rest l)) => phi

Induction Scheme (for min):
1. ~((rationalp r1) (rationalp r2)) => phi
2. (rationalp r1) /\ (rationalp r2) /\ (<= r1 r2) => phi
3. (rationalp r1) /\ (rationalp r2) /\ ~(<= r1 r2) => phi

Induction Scheme (for weave):
1. ~((listp x) /\ (listp y)) => phi
2. (listp x) /\ (listp y) /\ (endp x) => phi
3. (listp x) /\ (listp y) /\ ~(endp x) /\ (endp y) => phi
4. (listp x) /\ (listp y) /\ ~(endp x) /\ ~(endp y) /\ phi | ((x (rest x)) (y (rest y))) => phi

[Using Weave]
Obligation 1
C1. ~((listp x) /\ (listp y))
C2. (listp x)
C3. (listp y)
C4. (consp x)
C5. (consp y)
------------------
C6, f {C1, C2, C3, PL}

f => phi is t, so Obligation 1 is proven.

C1. (listp x)
C2. (listp y)
C3. (endp x)
C4. (consp x)
C5. (consp y)

C4. (consp y)
C5. (endp y)

Section C
Any implementation of stacks should satisfy the following properties.

(defthm new-stack-thm
  (empty-stackp (new-stack)))

(defthm empty-stack-new-stack
  (implies (empty-stackp s)
           (equal (new-stack) 
                  s)))

(defthm pop-push
  (implies (and (stackp s)
                (elementp e))
           (equal (stack-pop (stack-push e s))
                  s)))

(defthm stack-head-stack-push
  (implies (and (stackp s)
                (elementp e))
           (equal (stack-head (stack-push e s))
                  e)))

(defthm push-pop
  (implies (non-empty-stackp s)
           (equal (stack-push (stack-head s) (stack-pop s))
                  s)))

Consider the following implementation of stacks.

(defdata element all)
(defdata stack (listof element))
(defdata empty-stack nil)
(defdata non-empty-stack (cons element stack))

(defunc stack-push (e s)
  :input-contract (and (stackp s) (elementp e))
  :output-contract (non-empty-stackp (stack-push e s))
  (append s (list e)))

(defunc stack-pop (s)
  :input-contract (non-empty-stackp s)
  :output-contract (stackp (stack-pop s))
  (rest (rev s)))

(defunc stack-head (s)
  :input-contract (non-empty-stackp s)
  :output-contract (elementp (stack-head s))
  (first (rev s)))

(defunc new-stack ()
  :input-contract t
  :output-contract (empty-stackp (new-stack))
  ())

Question C1. 
The implementation above has a bug and not all of the properties above
hold. Which of the properties do not hold?  Provide a counterexample
for each such property. The number of such properties is 1 or more.

pop-push
(stack-pop (stack-push 1 '(1 2 3))) = '(3 2 1) != '(1 2 3)

push-pop
(stack-push (stack-head '(1 2 3)) (stack-pop '(1 2 3))) = (stack-push 3 '(2 1)) = '(2 1 3) != '(1 2 3)


Question C2.
Modify exactly one of the stack functions above so that all properties
are satisfied. Write the new definition below.

(defunc stack-pop (e s)
	:input-contract (non-empty-stackp s)
    :output-contract (stackp (stack-pop s))
	(rev (rest (rev s))))

 Section D: Tail Recursion II: Revenge of Weave
 
 a) Remember weave?  I told you we would keep using the same
 function for these proofs. Write a tail recursive
 version of weave (weave-t) and a wrapper function weave*
 Keep in mind the order that (first x) and (first y) are being
 added to acc.
 
 (defunc weave (x y)
  :input-contract (and (listp x)(listp y))
  :output-contract (listp (weave x y))
  (cond ((endp x) y)
        ((endp y) x)
        (t (cons (first x) 
                 (cons (first y)
                       (weave (rest x)(rest y)))))))
|#

(defunc weave-t (x y acc)
    :input-contract (and (listp x) (listp y) (listp acc))
    :output-contract (listp (weave-t x y acc))
    (cond ((endp x) (app (rev y) acc))
          ((endp y) (app (rev x) acc))
          (t (weave-t (rest x) (rest y) (cons (first y) (cons (first x) acc))))))
 
 (defunc weave* (x y)
   :input-contract (and (listp x)(listp y))
   :output-contract (listp (weave* x y))
   (rev (weave-t x y nil)))

 #|
 b) Now prove that weave* = weave. You should do all the steps we outlined
 in our tail recursive proof recipe.
 
Lemma : (listp x) /\ (listp y) /\ (listp acc) => (weave-t x y acc) = (app (rev (weave x y)) acc)

Proof of (weave* x y) = (weave x y):
C1. (listp x)
C2. (listp y)
---------------

LHS:(weave* x y)
  = {def of weave*}
    (rev (weave-t x y nil))
  = {Lemma}
    (rev (app (rev (weave x y)) nil))
  = {phi_app_nil}
    (rev (rev (weave x y))
  = {phi_rev_rev}
	(weave x y)
RHS:(weave x y)

LHS = RHS, so Conjecture is proven.

Proof of Lemma:
Induction Scheme: 
1. ~((listp x) /\ (listp y) /\ (listp acc)) => phi
2. (listp x) /\ (listp y) /\ (endp x) => phi
3. (listp x) /\ (listp y) /\ ~(endp x) /\ (endp y) => phi
4. (listp x) /\ (listp y) /\ ~(endp x) /\ ~(endp y) /\ phi | ((x (rest x)) (y (rest y)) (acc (cons (first y) (cons (first x) acc))))

Obligation 1:
C1. ~((listp x) /\ (listp y) /\ (listp acc)) 
C2. (listp x)
C3. (listp y)
C4. (listp acc)
------------------
C5. f {C1, C2, C3, C4, PL}

f => phi is t, so Obligation 1 is proven.

Obligation 2:
C1. (listp x)
C2. (listp y)
C3. (listp acc)
C4. (endp x)
----------------

LHS:(weave-t x y acc)
  = {def of weave-t, C4}
    (app (rev y) acc)
RHS:(app (rev (weave x y)) acc)
  = {def of weave, C4}
    (app (rev y) acc)

LHS = RHS, so Obligation 2 is proven.

Obligation 3:
C1. (listp x)
C2. (listp y)
C3. (listp acc)
C4. ~(endp x)
C5. (endp y)
---------------

LHS:(weave-t x y acc)
  = {def of weave-t, C4, C5}
    (app (rev x) acc)
RHS:(app (rev (weave x y)) acc)
  = {def of weave, C4, C5}
    (app (rev x) acc)

LHS = RHS, so Obligation 3 is proven.

Obligation 4:
C1. (listp x)
C2. (listp y)
C3. (listp acc)
C4. ~(endp x)
C5. ~(endp y)
[Let expr_a denote (cons (first y) (cons (first x) acc))]
C6. (listp (rest x)) /\ (listp (rest y)) /\ (listp expr_a) => (weave-t (rest x) (rest y) expr_a) = (app (rev (weave (rest x) (rest y))) expr_a)
-----------------
C7. (listp (rest x)) {C1, C4, def of listp}
C8. (listp (rest y)) {C2, C5, def of listp}
C9. (listp expr_a)) {C3, def of listp, consp axiom}
C10. (weave-t (rest x) (rest y) expr_a) = (app (rev (weave (rest x) (rest y))) expr_a) [Let this be denoted by C10A = C10B]

LHS:(weave-t x y acc)
  = {def of weave-t, C4, C5}
    (weave-t (rest x) (rest y) expr_a)
  = {C10}
    (app (rev (weave (rest x) (rest y))) expr_a)
RHS:(app (rev (weave x y)) acc)
  = {def of weave, C4, C5}
    (app (rev (cons (first x) (cons (first y) (weave (rest x) (rest y))))) acc)
  = {def of rev, first-rest axiom}
    (app (app (rev (cons (first y) (weave (rest x) (rest y)))) (list (first x))) acc)
  = {associativity of app}
    (app (rev (cons (first y) (weave (rest x) (rest y)))) (app (list (first x)) acc))
  = {def of app, def of endp, first-rest axiom}
    (app (rev (cons (first y) (weave (rest x) (rest y)))) (cons (first x) acc))
  = {def of rev, first-rest axiom}
    (app (app (rev (weave (rest x) (rest y))) (list (first y))) (cons (first x) acc))
  = {associativity of app}
    (app (rev (weave (rest x) (rest y))) (app (list (first y)) (cons (first x) acc)))
  = {def of app, def of endp, consp axiom, first-rest axiom}
    (app (rev (weave (rest x) (rest y))) expr_a)

LHS = RHS, so Obligation 4 is proven.

All Obligations have been proven, so the Lemma is proven.
