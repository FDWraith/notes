#### Preliminary Questions

1. Define "heat of reaction".
   The heat of reaction is the total energy change in the reaction's system. 

2. If 150 grams of water changes temperatures by 7.2$^{\circ}$C, how much energy flows?
   $$
   q_{\text{water}} = mc\Delta T = (150g)(4.184J/g^{\circ}C)(7.2^{\circ}C) = 4500 J
   $$
   

3. Describe how you would make 150 mL of 1.0 M HCl solution starting with 2.0 M HCl.
   Combine 75 mL of 2.0 M HCl with 75 mL of water. 

4. Use Hess's Law to calculate the heat of formation of CO(g) given the following information:
   $$
   \begin{align}
   &(1) &C(s) + O_2(g) \rightarrow CO_2(g) & \Delta H = -393.5 kJ \\
   &(2) &CO(g) + \frac{1}{2}O_2(g) \rightarrow CO_2(g) & \Delta H = -283.5 kJ
   \end{align}
   $$
   Find $\Delta H^{\circ}$ for the reaction: $C(s) + \frac{1}{2} O_2(g) \rightarrow CO(g)$
   $$
   \Delta H = \Delta H_{(1)} - \Delta H_{(2)} = (-393.5kJ)  - (-283.5kJ) = -100kJ
   $$
