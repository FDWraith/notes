2. Weak Electrolyte is a substance that does not ionize very well in water, but still enough to conduct some electrical current.

3. The proper disposal of salt solutions is into the WASTE SALT SOLUTIONS bottle.

## Post-Lab Questions

1. The mixture of ammonia and acetic acid ionized each other, as both don't ionize very well in water directly, but the mixture of the two formed enough ions for the electrical current to conduct.
2. $\text{NH}_3+\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} \leftrightarrow \text{NH}_4^+ + \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-$
3. The light gets dimmer and dimmer because while NaCl is a strong electrolyte, the more dilute the solution became, the further apart the ions would be, making it more difficult for the electrical current to go through. The number of ions stayed the same, but the body of water increased, increasing distance between ions.
4. Testing for electro-conductivity: Pentane will not conduct at all, Calcium Chloride will conduct strongly, and ammonium hydroxide will conduct weakly.
