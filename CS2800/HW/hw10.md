CS 2800 Homework 10 - Fall 2018


This homework is to be done in a group of 2-3 students. 

If your group does not already exist:

 * One group member will create a group in BlackBoard
 
 * Other group members then join the group
 
 Submitting:
 
 * Homework is submitted by one group member. Therefore make sure the person
   submitting actually does so. In previous terms when everyone needed
   to submit we regularly had one person forget but the other submissions
   meant the team did not get a zero. Now if you forget, your team gets 0.
   - It wouldn't be a bad idea for group members to send confirmation 
     emails to each other to reduce anxiety.

 * Submit the homework file (this file) on Blackboard. Do not rename 
   this file. There will be a 10 point penalty for this.

 * You must list the names of ALL group members below, using the given
   format. This way we can confirm group membership with the BB groups.
   If you fail to follow these instructions, it costs us time and
   it will cost you points, so please read carefully.


Names of ALL group members: Kevin Zhang, Jemin Park

Note: There will be a 10 pt penalty if your names do not follow 
this format.

 Inductive Proofs:
 - For all proofs below, solutions must be in the format described in class and
   in the notes. This includes:
     * Explicitly identifying an induction scheme and the function that gives
       rise to it.
     * Labeling general context (C1, C2....) and derived context.
     * Providing justifications for each piece of derived context.
     * Explicitly identifying axioms and theorems used
     * The if axioms and theorem substitutions are not required. You can use
       any other shortcuts previously identified.
     * PL can be given as justification for any propositional logic rules with the
      exceptions of Modus Ponens (MP) and Modus Tollens (MT)
     * Hocus Pocus (HP) is not permissible justification.
     * All arithmetic rules can be justified by writing "Arithmetic".
     
Previous homeworks (such as HW05) identify these requirements in more detail.

For this homework you may want to use ACL2s to help you.

Technical instructions:

- open this file in ACL2s as hw10.lisp

- make sure you are in BEGINNER mode. This is essential! Note that you can
  only change the mode when the session is not running, so set the correct
  mode before starting the session.

- insert your solutions into this file where indicated (usually as "...")

- only add to the file. Do not remove or comment out anything pre-existing
  unless asked to.

- make sure the entire file is accepted by ACL2s. In particular, there must
  be no "..." left in the code. If you don't finish all problems, comment
  the unfinished ones out. Comments should also be used for any English
  text that you may add. This file already contains many comments, so you
  can see what the syntax is.

- when done, save your file and submit it as hw10.lisp

- avoid submitting the session file (which shows your interaction with the
  theorem prover). This is not part of your solution. Only submit the lisp
  file!

1) Prove (msort l) is a permutation of l.
Make sure you clearly state your induction scheme

You can continue to assume that perm is transitive
Phi_perm_Trans: (listp x)/\(listp y)/\(listp z)/\(perm x y)
                => ((perm x z) = (perm y z))
                
You can assume that merging permutations of lists x and y results 
in a permutation of (merge x y)
phi_double_perm_merge:
(listp x)^(listp y)^(listp a)^(listp b)^(perm x y)^(perm a b) 
    => (perm (merge x y)(merge a b))

**NOTE: you can also thank your TA Eddie for wanting to give you this rather
than having to prove the truly terrible theorem: (perm x y) = (perm y x)


You may also want to look at some of our other theorems
(given or proven)
FINALLY, you'll quickly find out that you can't do the recursive part
of this proof without a lemma or lemmata.  What do we know about
first-half and last-half in relation to a list x??

Recall phi_merge_perm: (implies (and (lorp l1)(lorp l2) (orderedp l1)(orderedp l2))
                                (perm (app l1 l2) (merge l1 l2))))
Recall phi_msort_ordered: (lorp l) => (orderedp (msort l))

Prove phi_msort_perm: (lorp l) => (perm (msort l) l)

Induction Scheme:
1. ~IC => phi
2. IC /\ (endp l) => phi
3. IC /\ ~(endp l) /\ (endp (rest l)) => phi
4. IC /\ ~(endp l) /\ ~(endp (rest l)) /\ phi | (l (first-half l 0)) /\ phi | (l (last-half l 0)) => phi

    (perm (msort l) l)

2) How about the strange conjecture above.  You can't accept the theorem
prover being more capable than you.  Reclaim your honor and do the proof
youself.  Make sure you clearly identify your induction scheme

(rationalp e) ^ (lorp X) => ((merge (list e) X) = (insert e X))

Induction scheme:
1. ~IC => phi
2. IC ^ (endp X) => phi
3. IC ^ ~(endp X) ^ (<= e (first X)) => phi
4. IC ^ ~(endp X) ^ ~(<= e (first X)) ^ phi|(X (rest X)) => phi

(cons (first X)(merge (list e) (rest X)))
        
LHS: 
(merge (list e) X)
= {Def of merge, C9, C3, C4}
(cons (first X)(merge (list e) (rest X)))

RHS = LHS so obligation 4 is true.

All the obligations are true so the conjecture is true.

#| BONUS PRACTICE (this question only
Originally I intended to ask you to prove that (ssort l) is a permutation of l
This isn't trivial but it is certainly doable.  I leave it to you for extra practice
(and if you really REALLY want to prove that ssort sorts a list (it needs to be ordered
and a permutation)
...........Do for practice. No points.......

REASONING ABOUT TAIL-RECURSIVE FUNCTIONS

You can freely use the definitional and function contract theorems of
the functions we provide below or that we have covered in class. You
can also freely use any theorems we proved in class and in the lecture
notes.

Make sure you identify what induction scheme you are using.  For
example, suppose you were proving that app is associative:

(listp x) ^ (listp y) ^ (listp z) =>
(app (app x y) z) = (app x (app y z))

At the beginning of the proof you should say:

Proof by induction using (listp x).

You will be asked to define tail recursive versions of given
functions, using accumulators. This involves two function
definitions. 

For example, to define a tail recursive version of rev, we first
define rev-tl. rev-tl is recursive and has an extra argument, the
accumulator. Second, we define rev*, a non-recursive function that
calls rev-tl with the accumulater appropriately initialized and which
satisfies the theorem that rev* = rev, ie, :

(listp x) => (rev* x) = (rev x)

|#

;; Tail-recursive version of rev (auxiliary function)
(defunc rev-tl (x acc)
  :input-contract (and (listp x) (listp acc))
  :output-contract (listp (rev-tl x acc))
  (if (endp x)
      acc
    (rev-tl (rest x) (cons (first x) acc))))

;; Non-recursive version of rev that uses rev-tl
(defunc rev* (x)
  :input-contract (listp x) 
  :output-contract (listp (rev* x))
  (rev-tl x nil))

#|

You will also be asked to prove that the tail recursive version of a
function is equal to the original function.  For our
example, the theorem is

(implies (listp x)
         (equal (rev* x)
                (rev x)))

To do that you have to come up with lemmas; in particular you have to
come up with the right generalizations. If you choose to use ACL2s to
help you figure out the proofs, here is how you would do that:
|#

; This is the lemma we need
(defthm revt-rev
  (implies (and (listp x)
                (listp acc))
           (equal (rev-tl x acc)
                  (app (rev x) acc))))

; With the lemma above, the main theorem follows
(defthm rev*-rev
  (implies (listp a)
           (equal (rev* a)
                  (rev a))))

; The proofs were given in class.

Section 2.  Let's revisit a problem from the sample exam.  You've been given functions 
how-many-t and how-many* such that how-many = how-many*
|#
#|
(defunc how-many (e l)
  :input-contract (listp l)
  :output-contract (natp (how-many e l))
  (if (endp l)
    0
    (+ (if (equal e (first l)) 1 0)
       (how-many e (rest l)))))
|#
;; Feel free to rewrite how-many to not use a nested if statement and
;; instead use a cond.  You don't need to prove the equivalence
;; (just make sure they are logically the same)

;; REWRITE
(defunc how-many (e l)
    :input-contract (listp l)
    :output-contract (natp (how-many e l))
    (cond
        ((endp l) 0)
        ((equal e (first l)) (+ 1 (how-many e (rest l))))
        (t                   (how-many e (rest l)))))


;; DEFINE
;; how-many-t: All x List x Nat -> Nat
;; The tail recursive helper function for how-many*
;; where acc keeps a tally of the number of instances of
;; found so far in the list l.
(defunc how-many-t (e l acc)
    :input-contract (and (listp l) (natp acc))
    :output-contract (natp (how-many-t e l acc))
    (cond 
        ((endp l) acc)
        ((equal e (first l)) (how-many e (rest l) (+ 1 acc)))
        (t                   (how-many e (rest l) (+ 0 acc)))))

  
;; GIVEN
;; how-many*: All x List -> Nat
(defunc how-many* (e l)
  :input-contract (listp l)
  :output-contract (natp (how-many* e l))
  (how-many-t e l 0))

The goal is to prove the following conjecture:

phi : (listp l) => (how-many* e l) = (how-many e l)

That is, we want to show that the two functions compute the same result on
all inputs. We will prove this in several steps.

(a) Formulate a lemma that relates how-many-t to how-many, by filling in the ... below:

phi_1 : (listp l) /\ (natp acc) => (how-many-t e l acc) =  (+ acc (how-many e l))


(b) Prove phi_1. Use the induction scheme how-many-t gives rise to. 
We recommend your definition of how-many-t should use a cond with no nested conditionals. 
This is the I.S. generating pattern from the the notes and it should make
your proof simpler (or simpler to follow at least).

Induction Scheme:
1. ~((listp l) /\ (natp acc)) => phi
2. (listp l) /\ (natp acc) /\ (endp l) => acc
3. (listp l) /\ (natp acc) /\ ~(endp l) /\ (equal e (first l)) /\ phi | ((l (rest l)) (acc (+ 1 acc))) => phi
4. (listp l) /\ (natp acc) /\ ~(endp l) /\ ~(equal e (first l)) /\ phi | ((l (rest l)) (acc (+ 0 acc))) => phi

Obligation 1:
C1. ~((listp l) /\ (natp acc))
C2. (listp l)
C3. (natp acc)
-----------------
C4. f {C1, C2, C3, PL}

f => phi is t, so Obligation 1 is proven.

Obligation 2:
C1. (listp l)
C2. (natp acc)
C3. (endp l)
----------------

LHS:(how-many-t e l acc)
  = {def of how-many-t, C3}
    acc
RHS:(+ acc (how-many e l))
  = {def of how-many, C3}
    (+ acc 0)
  = {Arithmetic}
    acc

LHS = RHS, so Obligation 2 is proven.

Obligation 3:
C1. (listp l)
C2. (natp acc)
C3. ~(endp l)
C4. (equal e (first l))
C5. (listp (rest l)) /\ (natp acc) => (how-many-t e (rest l) (+ 1 acc)) = (+ (+ 1 acc) (how-many e (rest l)))
----------------------
C6. (listp (rest l)) {C1, C3, def of listp}
C7. (how-many-t e (rest l) (+ 1 acc)) = (+ (+ 1 acc) (how-many e (rest l))) {C2, C6, C5, MP}

LHS:(how-many-t e l acc)
  = {def of how-many-t, C3, C4}
    (how-many-t e (rest l) (+ 1 acc))
  = {C7}
    (+ (+ 1 acc) (how-many e (rest l)))
  = {Arithmetic}
    (+ acc (+ 1 (how-many e (rest l))))
RHS:(+ acc (how-many e l))
  = {def of how-many, C3, C4}
    (+ acc (+ 1 (how-many e (rest l))))

LHS = RHS, so Obligation 3 is proven.

Obligation 4:
C1. (listp l)
C2. (natp acc)
C3. ~(endp l)
C4. ~(equal e (first l))
C5. (listp (rest l)) /\ (natp acc) => (how-many-t e (rest l) (+ 0 acc)) = (+ (+ 0 acc) (how-many e (rest l)))
----------------------
C6. (listp (rest l)) {C1, C3, def of listp}
C7. (how-many-t e (rest l) (+ 0 acc)) = (+ (+ 0 acc) (how-many e (rest l))) {C2, C6, C5, MP}
    
LHS:(how-many-t e l acc)
  = {def of how-many-t, C3, C4}
    (how-many-t e (rest l) (+ 0 acc))
  = {C7}
    (+ (+ 0 acc) (how-many e (rest l)))
  = {Arithmetic}
    (+ acc (how-many e (rest l)))
RHS:(+ acc (how-many e l))
  = {def of how-many, C3, C4}
    (+ acc (how-many e (rest l))) 

LHS = RHS, so Obligation 4 is proven.

phi_l is proven.


(c) Using only equational reasoning (no induction!), prove the main
conjecture phi from above. Using phi_1 (which you just proved) this should
be very simple.
phi : (listp l) => (how-many* e l) = (how-many e l)

C1. (listp l)
--------------

LHS:(how-many* e l)
  = {def of how-many*}
    (how-many-t e l 0)
  = {phi_l}
    (+ 0 (how-many e l))
  = {arithmetic}
    (how-many e l)
RHS:(how-many e l)

LHS = RHS, so phi is proven.

Section 2: Question 2
I don't want the homework to be THAT much longer but I want to give some
more practice.  Thus do all the proof steps that you did above EXCEPT
don't prove your lemma.

- Write a tail recursive version of merge (merge-t)
and prove merge* = merge.
- Write the lemma you need to relate merge-t to merge
- Write the induction scheme you will use (and where it comes from)
- Assuming your lemma is true (don't prove it) prove merge* = merge
|#

(defunc merge-t (l1 l2 acc)
    :input-contract (and (lorp l1) (lorp l2) (lorp acc))
    :output-contract (lorp (merge-t l1 l2 acc))
    (cond
        ((endp l1) (app (rev acc) l2))
        ((endp l2) (app (rev acc) l1))
        ((<= (first l1) (first l2)) (merge-t (rest l1) (rest l2) (cons (first l1) acc)))
        (t (merge-t (rest l1) (rest l2) (cons (first l2) acc)))))

(defunc merge* (l1 l2)
    :input-contract (and (lorp l1) (lorp l2))
    :output-contract (lorp (merge* l1 l2))
    (merge-t l1 l2 nil))
#|
 
phi_merge_t: (lorp l1) /\ (lorp l2) /\ (lorp acc) => (merge-t l1 l2 acc) = (app (rev acc) (merge l1 l2))

Induction Scheme (from merge-t):
1. ~((lorp l1) /\ (lorp l2) /\ (lorp acc)) => phi
2. (lorp l1) /\ (lorp l2) /\ (lorp acc) /\ (endp l1) => phi
3. (lorp l1) /\ (lorp l2) /\ (lorp acc) /\ ~(endp l1) /\ (endp l2) => phi
4. (lorp l1) /\ (lorp l2) /\ (lorp acc) /\ ~(endp l1) /\ ~(endp l2) /\ (<= (first l1) (first l2)) /\ phi | ((l1 (rest l1)) (l2 (rest l2)) (acc (cons (first l1) acc))) => phi
5. (lorp l1) /\ (lorp l2) /\ (lorp acc) /\ ~(endp l1) /\ ~(endp l2) /\ ~(<= (first l1) (first l2)) /\ phi | ((l1 (rest l1)) (l2 (rest l2)) (acc (cons (first l2) acc))) => phi


Prove merge*= merge as described above

C1. (lorp l1)
C2. (lorp l2)
------------------

LHS:(merge* l1 l2)
  = {def of merge*)
    (merge-t l1 l2 nil)
  = {phi_merge_t}
    (app (rev nil) (merge l1 l2))
  = {def of rev, def of endp, consp axiom}
    (app nil (merge l1 l2))
  = {def of app, def of endp, consp axiom}
    (merge l1 l2)
RHS:(merge l1 l2)
 
LHS = RHS, so the Conjecture is true.
