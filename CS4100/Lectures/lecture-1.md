## Lecture 1

- Computers solve problems differently than humans do
- Turing Test (What the computer would need to pass)
  - Natural Language Process
  - Knowledge representation
  - automated reasoning
  - Understanding patterns
- Implications of Turing Test -> Acting Human, Not thinking Rationally
- Thinking Rationally
  - historical "laws of thought", eg. Aristotle, Socrates
  - logic tradition within AI 
  - Challenges:
    - Not always have correct or perfect solution
    - Uncertainty
    - Resource Limitations: Time/Memory/Knowledge
    - Representation of Knowledge -- eg. common sense
- Acting Rationally
  - Agent -- entity perceives and acts autonomously in order to achieve its goals
  - Rational agent -- choose behavior to achieve best possible outcome, given the resource constraints
