#### Preliminary Questions

1. What is meant by chemical equilibrium?
   Chemical equilibrium is a reaction in which the forward rate is equal to the reverse rate for a reversible reaction.
2. How does temperature affect the value of the equilibrium constant?
   The equilibrium constant changes as temperature changes.
3. What substances are present in your reaction mixture flask initially?
   Glacial Acetic Acid and Isopropyl Alcohol
4. What substances are present in the equilibrium mixture?
   Acetic Acid, Isopropyl Alcohol, Sulfuric Acid and Sodium Hydroxide
5. In which waste bottle are leftover contents of equilibrium mixture discarded?
   Waste should be discarded into the WASTE EQUILIBRIUM CONSTANT ACID/BASE bottle.
